The API is available in both Cloudera Express and Cloudera Enterprise, and comes with open-source client libraries. The goal of this project is to provide a ruby gem that can be used to manage Cloudera Hadoop installtions. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the cool things you can do with Cloudera Manager via the API:\r\n\r\n* Deploy an entire Hadoop cluster programmatically. Cloudera Manager supports HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, ZooKeeper, HBase, Hive, Oozie, Hue, Flume, Impala, Solr, Sqoop, Spark and Accumulo.\r\n* Configure various Hadoop services and get config validation.\r\n* Take admin actions on services and roles, such as start, stop, restart, failover, etc. Also available are the more advanced workflows, such as setting up high availability and decommissioning.\r\n* Monitor your services and hosts, with intelligent service health checks and metrics.\r\n* Monitor user jobs and other cluster activities.\r\n* Retrieve timeseries metric data.\r\n* Search for events in the Hadoop system.\r\n* Administer Cloudera Manager itself.\r\n* Download the entire deployment description of your Hadoop cluster in a json file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with the appropriate licenses, the API lets you:\r\n\r\n* Perform rolling restart and rolling upgrade.\r\n* Audit user activities and accesses in Hadoop.\r\n* Perform backup and cross data-center replication for HDFS and Hive.\r\n* Retrieve per-user HDFS usage report and per-user MapReduce resource usage report.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
